# tictactoe
A project from the Odin Project to practice OOP principles 

# Gist 
Write a tic tac toe game using the principles of OOP. 

# Approach
I decided to make two class: a board and players. The board has numbered cells and the players have marks to distribute across the board. Every turn's end for each player the board checks, if the game has been won. 

# What have I learned
I have already practiced OOP before, but now it feels much more structured, so: OOP principles. Ruby style guidelines, CLI and so on.
